# Music App Player - Example

This is a really fun project if you like music! That’s right, we’re going to build our own HTML music player.

Sure, we’re not going to be competing with Spotify, but this advanced HTML project is an excellent way to level up your existing skills when dealing with multimedia.

The goal here is to create a functional and stylish interface for our music player. We’ll also include a playlist to list songs and controls for play, pause, next, and previous.

Let’s take a look at the skills we’ll need to use to build our music player:

- HTML5 Audio: Control audio playback with JavaScript and the<audio> element.
- Custom Audio Controls: Create and style audio controls rather than relying on default browser controls.
- CSS3 Animations and Transitions: Use CSS to animate the play/pause button and the progress bar.
- JavaScript Event Handling: Use JavaScript to handle play, pause, and track change events and update the UI.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the music player is usable across different screen sizes.

You’ve probably noticed that we’re using JavaScript again here. This is going to be a recurring theme from this point onward.

Trust me; you just have to get comfortable with JS if you want to be a pro HTML developer. Like peanut butter and jelly, they are very often found together!

And seeing as we’re working on advanced projects, the JS code in this project is the longest we’ve used so far.

But don’t let this put you off, as it’s fairly straightforward when you get to grips with basic JavaScript.

Let’s now take a look at the source code for this project.

Remember to change the paths to your MP3 files in both the HTML and JS code, and as always, have fun playing around with this code.

In particular, see what happens when you make changes to the JS functionality. You might also want to try out a different color scheme or overall user interface to match your personality.

I’ve said it many times in this article, but the best way to learn how these projects work is to get stuck in, make changes, break things, and then fix them. 

It really is amazing how much you can learn by trying to deconstruct a project.
